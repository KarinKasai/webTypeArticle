            <p>
                Last spring, during the first days of sheltering at home, Proenza Schouler’s Jack McCollough and Lazaro
                Hernandez realized that they were in a bind. The world’s premium fabric mills, many based in the areas
                of northern Italy hardest hit by the pandemic, were all closed until further notice. How could a luxury
                fashion label design a new collection without any new fabric? After innumerable Zooms with suppliers,
                they decided to use bolts of deadstock fabric left over from past seasons. “We had this vast archive of
                fabrics from the past decade, and we really tapped into that—and in a strange way it forced us to be
                more creative,” recalls Hernandez. “Ninety percent of the Spring 2021 collection is made from archival
                fabrics that have been reworked in different ways.” Meeting the challenge with an optimistic
                throw-on-and-go collection of rib-knit separates and oversize tailoring in earthy tones, the duo also
                achieved their long-held goal of reducing waste. “This process has taught us a lot that we plan to take
                forward into future seasons,” McCollough explains. “We keep saying, ‘Wouldn’t it be sad if we got out of
                this and went back to life as it was?’ It has made us think outside the box.”
            </p>

            <h2>Relentless quest for the new and the next</h2>

            <p>
                That ability to pivot was required of nearly every design studio across the world this season, as brands
                grappled with unprecedented supply chain interruptions caused by Covid-19. It meant that they had to
                reconsider conventional beliefs about what constitutes high fashion. Upcycling, the process of reusing
                existing materials, used to conjure up crafty, scavenged visions of Mad Max , i.e., the opposite of
                luxury.Until recently, less than 1 percent of the fabric produced by the fashion industry was recycled
                into new garments, according to a 2017 report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a circular economy
                think tank, contributing to a loss of $500 billion worth of materials each year. This is an industry
                defined by its relentless quest for the new and the next, with labels churning out four or more
                collections per year, each made from new and different fabrics the leftovers of which almost immediately
                become, you guessed
                it, deadstock.

                Proenza was not alone in raiding its storage unit this season. At Alexander McQueen, eagle-eyed fans may
                have spotted the sweet pea fabric from the label’s Pre-Spring 2016 collection on shoulder bags, while
                much of the suiting and sultry lace dresses were produced with deadstock fabrics. Domenico Dolce and
                Stefano Gabbana also took a trip down memory lane for their Spring 2021
                Dolce & Gabbana Sicilian Patchwork collection. Squares of shimmering brocades, striped cottons, and
                leopard-print and polka dot chiffons sourced from their fabric archives blended many of the brand’s
                hallmarks. “The lockdown reminded us that we could creatively reuse what we had by transforming it and
                that everything can last forever,” says Gabbana.

            <blockquote class="quote-normal">“Limitations always expose your taste and point of view.” <br>
                <span>— Gabriela Hearst —</span>
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                For newly minted Chloé creative director Gabriela Hearst, who has used deadstock since her first runway
                collection for her namesake brand in 2017, the crisis has offered something of a litmus test.
                “Limitations always expose your taste and point of view,” she says. “Let’s be honest here, repurposed
                fabric can look like a hot mess. But if it’s done right, you shouldn’t even realize that the fabric
                hasn’t come straight from a mill.” She notes the shift in attitude: “When we started repurposing
                materials for our first show, it wasn’t spoken of in the luxury market, and I got in trouble with one of
                our mills because they felt it wasn’t the right language. Thankfully, that is all changing now.” Mill
                shutdowns also inspired innovative uses of unexpected materials.</p>

                Take Balenciaga creative director Demna Gvasalia’s “fur” coat, which is made from surplus shoelaces, a
                dress created from reused basketball nets (instantly recalling Cristóbal Balenciaga’s iconic fisherman’s
                net dress), and a sculptural moto jacket made from patchworked boots complete with rivets and buckles.

            <h3>6 fashion designers who championed sustainability in their 2020 collections</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Stella McCartney</li>
                <p>Renowned for her vegan approach to fashion, McCartney used satire as a medium to express herself:
                    Animals are not for humans to wear. In her fall 2020 collection at Paris Fashion Week, the British
                    designer sent models dressed as animals as a closing act to highlight her 100% vegan designs.</p>
                <li>Maison Margiela </li>
                <p>Creative director John Galliano took to upcycling his fall 2020 collection at Paris Fashion Week
                    where he handpicked pieces from charity shops and breathed new life into them. The result? A
                    spectacular, one-of-a-kind collection with a considerably low carbon footprint.</p>
                <li>Marine Serre</li>
                <p>At Paris Fashion Week, Marine Serre’s 50% upcycled collection featured elements suggestive of a fire:
                    burning motifs, masks, denim pieces with a scorched look. The 28-year-old designer may be new to the
                    game, but her thought-provoking showcase sure made the point clear: Our planet is on fire, and we
                    need to take action NOW.</p>
                <li>Jean Paul Gaultier</li>
                <p>The designer, who presented his last ever show at Paris Fashion Week, created a 200+ collection of
                    upcycled haute couture pieces for his spring/summer 2020 showcase, each one given a makeover in true
                    Gaultier style. The line made use of fabrics and materials from his archives as well, giving
                    recycling a big nod. </p>
                <li>Gabriela Hearst</li>
                <p>For her fall 2020 showcase at New York Fashion Week, Uruguayan designer proved that an entire
                    collection can be made from waste products. “Repurpose with Purpose” championed recycling and
                    upcycling through old textiles like vintage Turkish rugs that were transitioned into coats you’d
                    consider heirlooms.</p>
                <li>Richard Malone</li>
                <p>This young designer is setting a strong example for reputed brands to follow in his footsteps by
                    incorporating transparency and waste reduction in production processes. At London Fashion Week,
                    Malone presented the media with a mission statement on responsible practices—from using only organic
                    and plant-derived dyes to paying his artisans £25/hour—he was partaking in.</p>
            </ol>

            <h2>Higher-tech upcycling methods - Prada’s Re-Nylon project</h2>
            <p>Other brands made investments in higher-tech upcycling methods, like creating fabric from regenerated
                fibers. Prada’s Re-Nylon project—a collection of the label’s signature nylon bags crafted from nylon
                fabric made from recycled textiles and ocean plastic—expanded to ready-to-wear. Some of the season’s
                coveted clutch capes are made from Re-Nylon, literally turning trash into treasure. “With Re-Nylon, we
                can create products without using new resources, highlighting our continued efforts toward promoting
                responsible retail,” says Mrs. Prada’s son Lorenzo Bertelli, who is also the Prada Group’s Head of
                Marketing and Corporate Social Responsibility. “We are on track concerning the conversion of the entire
                virgin nylon production into regenerated nylon by the end of 2021.”</p>

                <blockquote class="quote-grid">Protecting our environmental future is fundamental to future-proofing the success of a
                    brand.<br>
                    <span>— Hassan Pierre —</span>
                </blockquote>

                <p>Whether this wave of pandemic-induced environmental responsibility will last is the question
                    concerning many advocates of conscious design. Anna Brismar, the sustainability consultant who
                    coined the term “circular fashion” in 2014, has her reservations. “Disruptions will result in some
                    embracing the need for more sustainable and circular practices, but many companies will likely
                    revert to business as usual,” she predicts. The issue there, explains Pierre, is that “the climate
                    emergency isn’t a trend, it’s not going away. Protecting our environmental future is fundamental to
                    future-proofing the success of a brand; it’s not just a marketing ploy.”</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Clear focus on what matters</h2>
            <p>Another eco silver lining is that the number of pieces heading into production has been drastically
                reduced, which will lead to less waste. “Post-Covid, those who can afford the ultimate luxury will want
                things that are special and closer to one-offs, and it won’t be so much about a $3,000 dress that’s
                available around the world,” says Hassan Pierre, a cofounder of Maison de Mode, a luxury fashion
                retailer for high-end, environmentally responsible fashion. Green fashion trailblazer Stella McCartney
                agrees. “Often we can only create limited-edition or one-off pieces because of the small quantities of
                leftover fabric and stock we have. That said, it also means we are making rare pieces that women can
                cherish, truly like wearable art.” One such collector’s piece, the Gabriela dress, combines strips of
                fabric from nine Stella ready-to-wear collections. “I used to be the only conscious fashion brand in the
                room,” McCartney says of her two decades spent campaigning for greater responsibility in luxury fashion.
                “And now I love to see other designers reevaluate what their purpose is.”</p>

            <p>The one takeaway from studios, both big and small, has been the renewed energy and optimism that the new
                limits have engendered. McCartney’s final reflection seems particularly apt. “This time has allowed me
                to return more focused on what matters,” she says. “I can see clearly there is so much overproduction,
                overconsumption, and relentless drive for newness, and I hope that more circular thinking can show that
                you can get that sense of novelty in other ways that are kinder to our planet.” Welcome to new 2.0:
                fresh, exclusive, and environmentally attentive, and with just a sprinkle of déjà vu.</p>
