                    Last spring, during the first days of sheltering at home, Proenza Schouler&rsquo;s Jack McCollough
                    and
                    Lazaro
                    Hernandez realized that they were in a bind. The world&rsquo;s premium fabric mills, many based in
                    the
                    areas
                    of northern Italy hardest hit by the pandemic, were all closed until further notice. How could a
                    luxury
                    fashion label design a new collection without any new fabric? After innumerable Zooms with
                    suppliers,
                    they decided to use bolts of deadstock fabric left over from past seasons. &#8220;We had this vast
                    archive
                    of
                    fabrics from the past decade, and we really tapped into that&mdash;and in a strange way it forced us
                    to be
                    more creative,&#8221; recalls Hernandez. &#8220;Ninety percent of the Spring 2021 collection is made
                    from
                    archival
                    fabrics that have been reworked in different ways.&#8221;
                </p>
                <p>Meeting the challenge with an optimistic
                    throw-on-and-go collection of rib-knit separates and oversize tailoring in earthy tones, the duo
                    also
                    achieved their long-held goal of reducing waste. &#8220;This process has taught us a lot that we
                    plan to
                    take
                    forward into future seasons,&#8221; McCollough explains. &#8220;We keep saying,
                    &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be sad if we got
                    out of
                    this and went back to life as it was?&rsquo; It has made us think outside the box.&#8221;</p>

                <h2>Relentless quest for<br>the new and the next</h2>
                <p>
                    That ability to pivot was required of nearly every design studio across the world this season, as
                    brands
                    grappled with unprecedented supply chain interruptions caused by Covid-19. It meant that they had to
                    reconsider conventional beliefs about what constitutes high fashion. Upcycling, the process of
                    reusing
                    existing materials, used to conjure up crafty, scavenged visions of Mad Max , i.e., the opposite of
                    luxury.
                </p>
                <p>Until recently, less than 1 percent of the fabric produced by the fashion industry was
                    recycled
                    into new garments, according to a 2017 report by the <a
                        href="https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/" class="hyperlink">Ellen MacArthur
                        Foundation</a>, a
                    circular economy
                    think tank, contributing to a loss of &dollar;500 billion worth of materials each year. This is an
                    industry
                    defined by its relentless quest for the new and the next, with labels churning out four or more
                    collections per year, each made from new and different fabrics the leftovers of which almost
                    immediately
                    become, you guessed
                    it, deadstock.</p>

                    Proenza was not alone in raiding its storage unit this season. At <a

                    may

                    bags,
                    while
                    much of the suiting and sultry lace dresses were produced with deadstock fabrics. Domenico Dolce and
                    Stefano Gabbana also took a trip down memory lane for their Spring 2021
                    <a href="https://www.dolcegabbana.com/en/" class="hyperlink">Dolce & Gabbana</a> Sicilian Patchwork
                    collection. Squares of

                    striped cottons, and
                    leopard-print and polka dot chiffons sourced from their fabric archives blended many of the
                    brand&rsquo;s
                    hallmarks. &#8220;The lockdown reminded us that we could creatively reuse what we had by
                    transforming it
                    and
                    that everything can last forever,&#8221; says Gabbana.

                    For newly minted <a href="https://www.chloe.com/ca" class="hyperlink">Chlo&eacute;</a> creative
                    director Gabriela Hearst, who has
                    used deadstock
                    since her first
                    runway
                    collection for her namesake brand in 2017, the crisis has offered something of a litmus test.
                    &#8220;Limitations always expose your taste and point of view,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Let&rsquo;s
                    be honest here,
                    repurposed
                    fabric can look like a hot mess. But if it&rsquo;s done right, you shouldn&rsquo;t even realize that
                    the fabric
                    hasn&rsquo;t come straight from a mill.&#8221; She notes the shift in attitude: &#8220;When we
                    started repurposing
                    materials for our first show, it wasn&rsquo;t spoken of in the luxury market, and I got in trouble
                    with
                    one of
                    our mills because they felt it wasn&rsquo;t the right language. Thankfully, that is all changing
                    now.&#8221;
                    Mill
                    shutdowns also inspired innovative uses of unexpected materials.</p>

                <ol type="1" class="designers-orderlist">
                    <li>Stella McCartney</li>
                    <p>Renowned for her vegan approach to fashion, McCartney used satire as a medium to express herself:
                        Animals are not for humans to wear. In her fall 2020 collection at Paris Fashion Week, the
                        British
                        designer sent models dressed as animals as a closing act to highlight her 100% vegan designs.
                    </p>
                    <li>Maison Margiela </li>
                    <p>Creative director John Galliano took to upcycling his fall 2020 collection at Paris Fashion Week
                        where he handpicked pieces from charity shops and breathed new life into them. The result? A
                        spectacular, one-of-a-kind collection with a considerably low carbon footprint.</p>
                    <li>Marine Serre</li>
                    <p>At Paris Fashion Week, Marine Serre&rsquo;s 50% upcycled collection featured elements suggestive
                        of a
                        fire:
                        burning motifs, masks, denim pieces with a scorched look. The 28-year-old designer may be new to
                        the
                        game, but her thought-provoking showcase sure made the point clear: Our planet is on fire, and
                        we
                        need to take action NOW.</p>
                    <li>Jean Paul Gaultier</li>
                    <p>The designer, who presented his last ever show at Paris Fashion Week, created a 200+ collection
                        of
                        upcycled haute couture pieces for his spring/summer 2020 showcase, each one given a makeover in
                        true
                        Gaultier style. The line made use of fabrics and materials from his archives as well, giving
                        recycling a big nod. </p>
                    <li>Gabriela Hearst</li>
                    <p>For her fall 2020 showcase at New York Fashion Week, Uruguayan designer proved that an entire
                        collection can be made from waste products. &#8220;Repurpose with Purpose&#8221; championed
                        recycling and
                        upcycling through old textiles like vintage Turkish rugs that were transitioned into coats
                        you&rsquo;d
                        consider heirlooms.</p>
                    <li>Richard Malone</li>
                    <p>This young designer is setting a strong example for reputed brands to follow in his footsteps by
                        incorporating transparency and waste reduction in production processes. At London Fashion Week,
                        Malone presented the media with a mission statement on responsible practices&mdash;from using
                        only
                        organic
                        and plant-derived dyes to paying his artisans &pound;25/hour&mdash;he was partaking in.</p>

                <p>Other brands made investments in higher-tech upcycling methods, like creating fabric from regenerated

                    signature nylon bags
                    crafted from nylon
                    fabric made from recycled textiles and ocean plastic&mdash;expanded to ready-to-wear. Some of the
                    season&rsquo;s
                    coveted clutch capes are made from Re-Nylon, literally turning trash into treasure. &#8220;With

                        brand.<br>
                        <span>&mdash; Hassan Pierre &mdash;</span>
                    </blockquote>


                    <p>Whether this wave of pandemic-induced environmental responsibility will last is the question
                        concerning many advocates of conscious design. Anna Brismar, the sustainability consultant who
                        coined the term &#8220;circular fashion&#8221; in 2014, has her reservations. &#8220;Disruptions
                        will result in
                        some
                        embracing the need for more sustainable and circular practices, but many companies will likely
                        revert to business as usual,&#8221; she predicts. The issue there, explains Pierre, is that
                        &#8220;the
                        climate
                        emergency isn&rsquo;t a trend, it&rsquo;s not going away. Protecting our environmental future is
                        fundamental
                        to
                        future-proofing the success of a brand; it&rsquo;s not just a marketing ploy.&#8221;</p>

                <h2>Clear focus on what matters</h2>
                <p>Another eco silver lining is that the number of pieces heading into production has been drastically
                    reduced, which will lead to less waste. &#8220;Post-Covid, those who can afford the ultimate luxury
                    will
                    want
                    things that are special and closer to one-offs, and it won&rsquo;t be so much about a &dollar;3,000
                    dress that&rsquo;s
                    available around the world,&#8221; says Hassan Pierre, a cofounder of Maison de Mode, a luxury
                    fashion
                    retailer for high-end, environmentally responsible fashion. Green fashion trailblazer <a
                        href="https://www.stellamccartney.com/ca" class="hyperlink">Stella
                        McCartney</a>
                    agrees. &#8220;Often we can only create limited-edition or one-off pieces because of the small
                    quantities
                    of
                    leftover fabric and stock we have. That said, it also means we are making rare pieces that women can
                    cherish, truly like wearable art.&#8221; One such collector&rsquo;s piece, the Gabriela dress,
                    combines strips
                    of
                    fabric from nine Stella ready-to-wear collections. &#8220;I used to be the only conscious fashion
                    brand in
                    the
                    room,&#8221; McCartney says of her two decades spent campaigning for greater responsibility in
                    luxury
                    fashion.
                    &#8220;And now I love to see other designers reevaluate what their purpose is.&#8221;</p>

                <p>The one takeaway from studios, both big and small, has been the renewed energy and optimism that the
                    new
                    limits have engendered. McCartney&rsquo;s final reflection seems particularly apt. &#8220;This time
                    has allowed
                    me
                    to return more focused on what matters,&#8221; she says. &#8220;I can see clearly there is so much
                    overproduction,
                    overconsumption, and relentless drive for newness, and I hope that more circular thinking can show
                    that
                    you can get that sense of novelty in other ways that are kinder to our planet.&#8221; Welcome to new

                    fresh, exclusive, and environmentally attentive, and with just a sprinkle of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.
